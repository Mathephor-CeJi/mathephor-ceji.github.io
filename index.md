I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Department of Mathematics, Tsinghua University, joining the group of Youjin Zhang.  I received my Ph.D. from School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University in June 2024, advised by Shuai Guo. Before that, I got my B.Sc. in mathematics at Peking University also.

I work on algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. I am interested in mathematics inspired by string-theoretic physics, focusing on mirror symmetry and Gromov-Witten theory. Their interactions with integrable systems, Eynard-Orantin topological recursion and quantum geometry are of special interest. 

My name in Chinese character is хнг чнЦ (Ji, Ce). For non-native speaker in Chinese: please feel free to pronounce my name as you think how it should be pronounced :)
